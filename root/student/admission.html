		<h1>Admissions</h1>

		<p>The Admissions department at Selkirk College accepts applications for admission up to 12 months prior to the start of any program. If you are an International Student, please consult <a href="../internaional.html">International Student Admissions.</a></p>

		<p>Some programs outline a specific time schedule for the application procedure that includes a last date for submission of application and supporting documentation. Late applications to all programs will be considered, sub,ject to availability of spaces. Please check your specific program area for further information in this regard.</p>

		<p>The Admissions department does not maintain waitlists for program entry. Applicants who are not accepted program of study must re-apply to gain consideration for a subsequent entry date.</p>


		<h2>Winter Admission</h2>

		<p>Students may begin academic studies and college preparatory studies in January. Students who enrol for the first time in January may find that their choice of courses is limited and may not be able to take a full course load. If you intend to enrol for a January start, please consult a counsellor for additional information.</p>


		<h2>Academic University Transfer</h2>

		<p>Students applying for admission to the Academic University Transfer program should forward a completed application form and all supporting documents as early as possible to ensure course selection. (Program application deadlines are outlined under specific program descriptions).</p>


		<h2>Pre-admission Assessment</h2>

		<p>All applicants must complete pre-admission assessment of language and mathematics skills unless specifically exempted. This assessment does not affect admissibility to a program, but is only for purposes of providing advisory information to applicants about their levels of academic skills in relation to the demands of the program to which they are applying. The results are intended to help applicants in their course planning; to allow them to make informed decisions regarding their readiness for enrolment; to improve student success in our courses and/or programs, and to reduce attrition due to lack of adequate skills. Registration will not be deemed to be complete until such assessment has been done.</p>

		<p>Exemptions will be granted to students who have already completed relevant post-secondary courses in mathematics and/or English. To obtain an exemption, please provide an appropriate transcript to the Admissions Office.</p>
